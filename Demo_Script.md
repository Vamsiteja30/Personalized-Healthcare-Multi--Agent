# üé• Demo Video Script - Healthcare Multi-Agent System

## üìù Simple English Script (3-5 minutes)

### üé¨ **Opening (30 seconds)**
"Hi everyone! Today I'm going to show you a really cool healthcare app I built. It's called NOVA, and it's like having six smart AI assistants that help you take care of your health. Think of it as your personal health buddy that remembers everything about you and gives you personalized advice."

### üè• **What the App Does (45 seconds)**
"Let me show you what makes this special. First, you log in with your user ID - we have 100 different people in our system, each with their own health profile. Some are vegetarian, some have diabetes, some have other health conditions. The app knows all this and tailors everything just for you."

### ü§ñ **The Six AI Assistants (1 minute)**
"Now, here are the six smart assistants that work together:

1. **The Greeting Assistant** - It says hello to you by name and welcomes you with a voice message
2. **The Mood Tracker** - You tell it how you're feeling today, and it keeps track of your mood over time
3. **The Glucose Monitor** - If you have diabetes, you can log your blood sugar readings, and it makes sure they're in a safe range
4. **The Food Logger** - You tell it what you ate, and it automatically figures out the nutrition - like how many carbs, protein, and fat
5. **The Meal Planner** - This is the coolest part! It looks at your diet preferences, health conditions, and current mood, then creates a personalized meal plan just for you
6. **The General Assistant** - You can ask it any health question anytime, and it gives you helpful answers"

### üñ•Ô∏è **Live Demo (2 minutes)**
"Let me show you how it works. I'll log in as User 1 - Michael Smith, who's vegetarian and has arthritis and depression.

*[Show login screen]*
"See how it greets me with my name and plays a voice message? That's the Greeting Assistant working.

*[Show dashboard]*
"Now I'm in the main dashboard. Look at these charts - they show my glucose readings over time and my mood patterns. Everything updates in real-time.

*[Show mood tracking]*
"Let me log my mood. I'm feeling happy today. *[Click mood tracking]* See how it instantly updates the chart?

*[Show CGM logging]*
"Now let me log a glucose reading. I'll enter 120, which is in the healthy range. *[Enter reading]* Perfect! It shows green because it's safe.

*[Show food logging]*
"Let me log what I ate for breakfast. I'll type 'oatmeal with berries and nuts'. *[Enter food]* Look! It automatically calculated the nutrition - 25 grams of carbs, 8 grams of protein, 12 grams of fat. That's the Food Logger working its magic.

*[Show meal planning]*
"Now the exciting part - let me generate a personalized meal plan. *[Click generate meal plan]* 

Look at this! It created three meals just for me:
- Breakfast: Greek yogurt with berries and turmeric (good for arthritis)
- Lunch: Quinoa bowl with vegetables (vegetarian-friendly)
- Dinner: Lentil curry with brown rice (mood-boosting foods)

Notice how it's considering that I'm vegetarian, have arthritis, and depression. It's not just random meals - it's personalized health advice!"
